Canto.PHP
=========

This is a port of the canto.js library for JavaScript to PHP. It wraps
around the PECL/Cairo library to add a fluent API mostly matching that
of the original API.

This PHP port is written by Michael Maclean <mgdm@php.net> with thanks
to David Flanagan for the inspiration.


Example
=======

$s = new CairoImageSurface(CairoFormat::ARGB32, 400, 400);
$c = new Canto($s);
$data = $c->moveTo(100, 100)
            ->lineTo(200, 200, 200, 250, 100, 250, 100, 100)
            ->stroke();
